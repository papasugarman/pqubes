# PQubes - Post-Quantum key exchange protocol
[Research paper](https://pqubes.com/pqubes.pdf)

PQubes is a Networking protocol using which an insecure medium can be secured using Post-Quantum encryption algorithms. 
At this time, the PQubes key exchange utilizes the NTRU Quantum-secure encryption algorithm to provide security and utilizes SHA-512 to provide authenticity to a connection.

## PQubes Demos
The demos folder contains two demos made in javascript that implement the PQubes protocol. 
### a) Simple client-server communication
### b) FyrChat - a GUI based disposable chat application
